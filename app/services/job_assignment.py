    Optimally assign jobs to salesmen based on urgency, clusters, and time constraints.
    
    The flow is:
    1. Sort jobs by urgency.
    2. Cluster jobs into 4 clusters.
    3. Copy jobs and salesmen into unassigned/ unrostered lists.
    4. For each salesman (one at a time) assign jobs until they reach capacity:
         a. Look over unassigned jobs (skipping jobs whose clusters are in exhausted_clusters)
            to find the first job the salesman can complete.
         b. Once found, focus on that jobâ€™s cluster:
             i. Iterate over jobs in that cluster (ordered by urgency) and assign all that the salesman can complete.
            ii. Remove each assigned job from the working list and, if no more jobs in this cluster can be assigned, mark the cluster as exhausted.
         c. If no assignable job is found outside exhausted clusters, the salesman is considered at capacity.
         d. Remove all jobs assigned in this iteration from unassigned jobs.
    5. After all salesmen are processed (or no more assignable jobs exist),
       any remaining jobs are left as unassigned in the final roster.
